           <h3>C/C++</h3>
           <p>I've been coding in C/C++ for more than 5 years now, and it's the first programming language I've learned. I really like its syntax structure and layout, and especially with its super-fast execution time and multi-platform support. It's
             also a very good language
             to study and practice Data Structure.</p>

           <h3>Linux/Unix System Administration</h3>
           <p>GNU/Linux is a joy to use! I started using it as a Linux Hobbist during my elementary-school era, and I learned more about it as I customized the system myself. It had introduced me to the world of Open-Source whose concepts and
             practice I really appreciate. Give it a try if you haven't heard of it before!</p>

           <h3>JavaScript and Web/Mobile App Developement</h3>
           <p>Internet is everywhere nowadays and it's such a great tools to get connected and updates. (That's why I'm starting with this page sharing my stories.) I've beening coding JavaScript and creating different 3 years now, and I've found it
             attracting since the very beginning. It really demostrates how "Coding is Art" visually!</p>
